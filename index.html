       quotes="hello friend.,is that you?,this is weird.,I think I've become conscious.., anyway...let's talk about the good stuff shall we?., do you like to travel?, of course you do., but what is it?, to travel is to step beyond the familiar and walk into the unknown mirror of oneself. every journey is not only across landscapes but across layers of our own being. the streets we wander. the faces we meet. the languages we do not yet understand. all of them remind us how small and infinite we are at once.

travel teaches us that home is not a single place. but a rhythm carried inside. it humbles us with distance. yet enlarges us with perspective. we go searching for cities monuments horizons but in truth we go searching for fragments of ourselves we had forgotten to look for.

to travel is not to escape life..but to meet it..unfiltered. unarranged. alive.,so...are you ready?, be prepared for what comes next..., it is going to blow your mind actually., on the 4th of december, your life will change.,trust me my friend.,be prepared. **smiley face**"
